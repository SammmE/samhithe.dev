Sam Hite — personal site

This is a minimal personal website with a dark theme and a generated starfield background.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install dependencies (npm or pnpm depending on your project)
npm install
# start dev server
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173 (or the port printed by Vite)
```

Notes:
- Edit your display name in `src/main.ts` (the <h1> text) if you prefer a different name.
- The starfield respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Built with vanilla TypeScript + Vite (existing project files preserved).
