## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or bun

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SammmE/MARVIN.git
   cd MARVIN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to start using OSCAR

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

1. **Data Tab**: Import your dataset or use sample data (sinusoid, spiral, etc.)
2. **Hyperparameters Tab**: Configure your network architecture and training parameters
3. **Model Tab**: Visualize your network architecture and see layer details
4. **Training Tab**: Train your model with real-time monitoring and controls

### Example: Training a Simple Regression Model

1. Go to the **Data** tab and select the "Sinusoid" preset
2. Switch to **Hyperparameters** and set:
   - 2 Dense layers with 64 and 32 units
   - ReLU activation functions
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Adam optimizer
3. Navigate to **Training** and click "Start Training"
4. Watch as your model learns to approximate the sine function!
