PhysicsSim is an advanced 2D physics simulation engine built in Rust, aimed at providing high-performance, real-time particle tracking and visualization.

## 🌟 Features

*   **High-Performance Rendering**: Powered by `wgpu` for efficient, GPU-accelerated rendering.
*   **Real-Time Physics**: accurate 2D physics simulation including:
    *   Configurable Gravity `(m/s²)`
    *   Particle Mass `(kg)`
    *   Wall Collisions with adjustable bouncing and damping.
    *   Variable Time-Steps and FPS control (supports slow-motion).
*   **Interactive Controls**:
    *   **Drag & Spawn System**: Intuitively create particles by dragging the mouse.
        *   **Left Drag**: Spawn particle with initial **Velocity**.
        *   **Right Drag**: Spawn particle with initial **Acceleration**.
    *   **Live Configuration**: Adjust physics parameters on the fly using the built-in `egui` control panel.
*   **Visualization & Analysis**:
    *   Real-time graphing of particle position, velocity, and acceleration using `egui_plot`.
    *   Visual vectors for velocity and acceleration.
    *   Performance metrics (FPS, Memory Usage, Render Time).

## 🎮 Controls

### Mouse
*   **Left Click & Drag**: Create a particle with initial **velocity** based on drag distance/direction.
*   **Right Click & Drag**: Create a particle with initial **acceleration** based on drag distance/direction.
