## The Problem

When making the **MNIST-OS**, I wanted to visualize the weights updating in real-time. I mapped the VGA memory buffer at \`0xB8000\` but all I got was garbage.

### The Fix

I realized I was writing to the text-mode buffer instead of switching to **Mode 13h**.

> **Warning**: Always check your BIOS interrupt vectors before writing to video memory.

\`\`\`assembly
mov ax, 0x13
int 0x10
\`\`\`

Now I see the weights converging beautifully.
